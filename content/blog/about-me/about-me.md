Coming from a family of all software engineers and developers, I was the last hold out. I started school as a Biology major, switched to Dental Hygiene, and then decided I didn't want to work in healthcare, so I dropped out of school for a bit to reconsider my options. I took an online Python course, got about halfway through it and decided it was interesting enough to pursue so here I am. Last summer I got an internship at a software company in Orem and they ended up hiring me. Between work and school, I don't have a lot of time for hobbies right now, but I love watching movies. I'm a huge movie buff and often base my decision to watch a movie based on the director rather than the movie star or plot. I know, it's very pretentious of me. 

My JavaScript experience consists of DGM 1600, DGM 2760, and everything I've learned in my job where I mostly write tests, fix bugs, and try to keep up. I consider myself a beginner, and I'm mostly comfortable with manipulating objects and arrays, and unit testing. I could definitely improve on everything else. I still struggle with Promises, and I've spent the most time trying to understand them. 

My favorite part of web development is the feeling you get after struggling to get something to work for hours (or days)and it finally works. I love that feeling. I like the problem-solving aspect of it as well. It's just like a huge, giant, convoluded puzzle.  

In this class, I want to get a better understanding of different frameworks to a point where I can utilize them in solo projects or at work. I'm only vaguely familiar with React, but I've never worked with any of the others. I also want to understand more of the "big picture" of how everything (JavaScript, frameworks, plugins, etc.) works together. I understand pieces, but I struggle seeing how certain things relate to one another.

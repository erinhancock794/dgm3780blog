#### Git
Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to versatility with projects. It's an important tool with web development because it helps you keep track of your coding history, work on specific features on branches without disrupting the remote source code, and working efficiently with multiple developers. It solves the problem of having multiple developers working on one repository because you can easily clone a copy of the repo and work on your local computer. 

#### GitHub
GitHub is a hosting platform build to use and support git. This is how you can access tons of open-source projects, as well as host your own projects. GitHub enables you to create Pull Requests that can be merged into the repository. This is great for code reviews, and having an easily accessible place to view commit history. 

It's important to note that Git and GitHub are not the same. You can use Git without using Github since you can store your code elsewhere. GitHub is a platform on the Internet so that anyone (with the correct permissions) can access your work.

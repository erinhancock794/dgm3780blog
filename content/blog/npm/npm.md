NPM was originally called "Node Package Manager" but has since become much more than that. It's a very large software registry. It has three main components. It's a package manager for JavaScript and it can be used for front and backend. This includes a vast registry. It can  be used for command line interfaces, and there's also a website.

The package manager component is important because it just makes coding easier. NPM has essentially become the go-to for many programmers because of how much simpler it makes coding JavaScript.

NPM can also be used in command line interfaces, which is great if you want to automate something via the command line, or you can set up projects to run certain tasks.

The NPM website provides many benefits. You can use it to look for packages, set up profiles, or set up an organization to manage public or private packages. It has a ton of modules you can implement into your projects as well as documentation on how to use them. A module is a file or directory located in a ```node_modules``` directory that can be loaded by the ```require()``` function.

When I get stuck working on a project because I don't know how to write code to create whatever vision I have in my head, I usually go to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) because it explains how things work and gives examples. I don't have a lot of syntax memorized so I have to look up how to write things all the time. If I'm diving into something new, I start reading the documentation. That's what I did to make this blog with Gatsby (I actually started with Jekyll and couldn't get it to work, so I switched gears).

I haven't followed along with very many tutorials unless they teach me how to do something very basic that I don't understand by reading MDN or the documentation. I did one tutorial to make my own movie database with React, and I didn't retain anything so I think those types of tutorials are a waste of time. But they are really satisfying, so it can be tempting to fall into the trap of following those tutorials all the time. It's a slippery slope to "Tutorial Hell" where you regurgitate others' code and make something cool, but you can't recreate it on your own. 

I learn better when I read the documentation, or watch a video that explains a specific concept to me, and then code from there. While that sounds simple, it takes forever. When I'm learning something new, I spend hours on it. I hate how long it takes, but it's the most effective way for things to stick in my brain. That essentially means I swear at my computer and cry out of frustration a LOT. #letsnormalizecryinginwebdevelopment 
I also learn a lot by working with other developers and reading and reviewing their code (and vice versa). 

If someone were to start learning web development, I'd tell them to pick one programming language, and stick to it until they're comfortable with it. I'd recommend that they begin by doing beginner tutorials on sites like [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to become familiar with the basic syntax and concepts. Then I'd tell them to do a couple different types of tutorials that show you how to make something (like a movie database site or a weather app) so they get used to coding and seeing results from it. Since that's a slippery slope, I'd recommend only doing a few of those and then finding a VERY easy project to build. I'd also tell them to get on Reddit and join a bunch of programming subreddits because learning to code can be very discouraging and those subreddits have helped encourage me. I'd also tell someone who wants to learn web development that it's not easy, but it's worth it.
